This project is to create a web app that enables live-action pacman on city 
streets. Users can create multiple maps that represent areas of a real city.
When playing a game, users pick a game and a role (pacman or one of four
ghosts). They then communicate via cell phone or other means with a person
on the street representing their player. They use the web app to communicate
the physical player's location to the other controllers, see the other players'
locations and on that basis instruct their physical player on what to do.
Actions in the game happen in reality: a ghost tagging Pacman, or Pacman
tagging a ghost will have the same effect as in the video game. The web user's
job is to then click the player who was tagged.
